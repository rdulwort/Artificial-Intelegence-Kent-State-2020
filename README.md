Graph Search:
C++ code. Run in visual studios. To change graph use "Graph g(X);" where 'X' is the number of vertices the graph has, 
and "g.addEdge(x, y);" where 'x' and 'y' are the two vertices being connected by and edge. this program assumes the edge goes both ways between the nodes. 
To tun a search use "g.BFS(Z);" "g.DFS(Z);" where 'Z' is the beginning node.
